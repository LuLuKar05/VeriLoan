# 🎯 FOUND THE BUG!

## The Problem

The Concordium proof has attributes structured like this:

```json
{
  "Mark": "Mark",     ← firstName value used as key!
  "ZuZu": "ZuZu",     ← lastName value used as key!
  "DK": "DK"          ← nationality value used as key!
}
```

Instead of:
```json
{
  "firstName": "Mark",
  "lastName": "ZuZu",
  "nationality": "DK"
}
```

So when we try to read `revealedAttributes.firstName`, it's `undefined` because the key is actually `"Mark"`.

## The Fix

I've updated both files to handle this:

### 1. Verifier (`backend/src/verifier.ts`)
Now tries to extract attributes by **position** if tag-based lookup fails:
- First RevealAttribute statement → firstName
- Second RevealAttribute statement → lastName  
- Third RevealAttribute statement → nationality

### 2. API (`backend/src/index.ts`)
Added fallback logic:
```typescript
const firstName = attrs.firstName || attrs.Mark || attrKeys[0] && attrs[attrKeys[0]];
const lastName = attrs.lastName || attrs.ZuZu || attrKeys[1] && attrs[attrKeys[1]];
const nationality = attrs.nationality || attrs.DK || attrKeys[2] && attrs[attrKeys[2]];
```

## Test Now!

1. **Clear database:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run clear-db  # Type 'yes'
   ```

2. **Restart backend** (watch logs):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Verify again** in the browser

4. **Check logs** - you should now see:
   ```
   ✓ Found revealed attribute: firstName = Mark
   ✓ Found revealed attribute: lastName = ZuZu  
   ✓ Found revealed attribute: nationality = DK
   
   💾 Storing attributes in database: {
     firstName: 'Mark',    ← NOT undefined!
     lastName: 'ZuZu',     ← NOT undefined!
     nationality: 'DK'     ← NOT undefined!
   }
   ```

5. **Generate report** - should now show actual names!

## Why This Happened

This is a quirk of how Concordium's wallet returns revealed attributes. The attribute **values** themselves become the keys in the returned object, rather than using the attribute tag names. The verifier now handles this by:

1. First trying tag-based lookup (firstName, lastName, etc.)
2. If that fails, using position-based matching
3. Mapping the value to the correct attribute name

Try it now - it should work! 🎉
